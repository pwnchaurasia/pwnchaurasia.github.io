title: "Onboard A New Dev"
date: 2025-03-03
summary: "This blog extends our previous discussion on WebSockets with FastAPI. Sure, everything worked fine, but I conveniently skipped the most important part—security. Oops! Consider this my redemption post, where I’ll dive deep into securing WebSocket connections and, of course, sneak in some crude humor because why should security be boring?"
description: "Learn how to secure WebSocket connections by comparing session-based authentication and JWTs, understanding the importance of WSS over WS, and implementing additional security measures like message validation, rate limiting, and CORS policies. This blog builds on our FastAPI WebSocket implementation to ensure your real-time applications are both performant and secure."
