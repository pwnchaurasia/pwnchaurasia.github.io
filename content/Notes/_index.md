This is where I document what I take away from books I read - not reviews or expert analysis, just what resonated with me or completely went over my head.

I prefer books that people recommend, so you'll find notes on everything from engineering and philosophy to mythology and sci-fi. My interpretations might be wrong, but writing helps me think more clearly.

Consider these snapshots of how I understood something at a particular moment in time.
