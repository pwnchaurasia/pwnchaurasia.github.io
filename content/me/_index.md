title = "About Me"
+++

I'm a software engineer who loves building things. When I'm not writing code, you'll find me on my Royal Enfield Himalayan exploring roads less traveled. In 2022, I spent 18 days riding through Leh Ladakh.

I'm based in Bangalore, originally from Dhanbad, Jharkhand. I've been building backend systems and distributed architectures for about 9 years. What excites me is solving problems end to end - tracing issues through complex systems and fixing them at the root.

Currently working on Wayfind, a side project for the motorcycle community. I read a lot, mostly books people recommend to me. Started this blog to build a writing habit because writing helps me think more clearly.
