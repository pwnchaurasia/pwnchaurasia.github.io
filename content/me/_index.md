Hi, I'm Pawan Chaurasia. Most people call me Pawan. I'm from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, currently building web applications in Bangalore, India.

I'm a software engineer who loves building things - both digital and physical. When I'm not writing code, you'll find me on my Royal Enfield Himalayan exploring roads less traveled. After buying my bike I have covered most of southern part of India and did every bike rider's dream ride to Ladakh in 2022.

I've been building backend systems and distributed architectures for about 9 years. What excites me is solving problems end to end - tracing issues through complex systems and fixing them at the root. Currently working on Wayfind, a side project for the motorcycle community.

I read, mostly books people recommend to me rather than following any particular system. I started this blog to build a writing habit because I've found that writing helps me think more clearly about both technical problems and life in general.

I'm sharing my thoughts on books I read, things I build, and lessons I'm learning. I'm experimenting through life, making mistakes and improving myself. I'm just exploring the world and tech as I go.

This is my corner of the internet where I think out loud.
