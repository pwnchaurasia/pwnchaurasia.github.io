A Senior Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience building systems that solve real problems. I specialize in payment systems, distributed architectures, and turning complex business requirements into reliable software that scales.

## My Journey

- **Senior Software Engineer @ <a href="https://www.latitudefinancial.com.au/" target="_blank" class="red-link">LatitudePay</a>** (2022-2024): Led a 5-person payments team, architected settlement ledger processing 60-80k SGD daily with HSBC integration, and solved payment blocking issues affecting high-value transactions.

- **Module Lead @ <a href="https://www.mindtree.com" target="_blank" class="red-link">Mindtree (Cisco Project)</a>** (2020-2022): Built comprehensive QA automation platform for Cisco servers, reducing regression testing time by 2 days per cycle through parallel processing and smart scheduling.

- **Full Stack Developer @ Anlyz Cyber Secure** (2019-2020): Developed malware analysis dashboard using ElasticSearch, Django, and React for real-time threat intelligence.

- **Early Career**: Full-stack development roles building foundation skills across web technologies and enterprise systems.

## What I Actually Do

**ðŸ”§ Backend Systems:** I build payment processors, APIs, and distributed systems that handle real money and real users. My code processes thousands of transactions and I take that responsibility seriously.

**ðŸ“Š Problem Solving:** When payment failures were blocking customers from â‚¹1-8L transactions, I implemented exponential backoff retry mechanisms. When CI/CD took 75 minutes, I redesigned the architecture to run in 25 minutes.

**ðŸ‘¥ Technical Leadership:** Code reviews, architecture decisions, and mentoring engineers. I believe good software comes from good teams, not just good code.

## Real Projects I've Built

#### Payment Recovery System
Diagnosed why customers were getting blocked from making payments, worked with Stripe support to understand the issue, and implemented a solution that prevented bank-level payment blocks while maintaining transaction security.

#### Settlement Ledger for LatitudePay
Built the financial backbone for merchant payouts - handling profit calculations, refund logic based on time windows, and real-time reconciliation with HSBC Singapore. This system processed millions in SGD daily.

#### Cisco Server Testing Platform
Automated QA testing for multiple Cisco server configurations with real-time log monitoring, parallel execution, and flexible scheduling. Eliminated manual testing bottlenecks for the entire QA team.

#### Service Gateway (Freelance)
Serverless job processing system handling unpredictable workloads up to 3 hours - video transcription, screenshot capture, and FFMPEG processing. Migrated from traditional queue-workers to AWS Fargate containers for better resource utilization.

## My Technical Stack

**Backend:** Python (Django, FastAPI), PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, WebRTC  
**Cloud:** AWS (Fargate, Lambda, SQS, SNS), GCP, Docker, Kubernetes  
**Integration:** Payment APIs (Stripe, HSBC), RESTful services, Microservices  
**DevOps:** GitLab CI/CD, Nginx, containerization, performance optimization  

## Current Side Project

**WayFind:** Building a React Native app for hands-free motorcycle group communication using WebRTC and Bluetooth intercom integration. Solving the problem of same-brand/1KM range limitations that current intercom systems have.

## Why I Write Code

I enjoy solving problems that matter - whether it's preventing payment failures for customers or optimizing deployment pipelines for developer productivity. Good software makes people's lives easier, and that's what motivates me.

My blog posts about [WebSocket security](https://rjsnh1522.github.io/engineering/securing_websocket_connections/) and [FastAPI scaling](https://rjsnh1522.github.io/engineering/websocket_in_fast_api/) reflect my approach: practical solutions to real technical challenges.
