title = "About Me"
+++

I'm a software engineer who loves building things - both digital and physical. When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me on my Royal Enfield Himalayan, exploring roads less traveled. In 2022, I spent 18 days riding through Leh Ladakh, which was one of those experiences that reminds you why you love being alive.

I'm currently based in Bangalore, though I'm originally from Dhanbad, Jharkhand. There's something about this city that keeps me energized - maybe it's the mix of old and new, or just the fact that there's always something interesting happening in the tech scene here.

## What I Do

I've been building software for about 9 years now, mostly backend systems and distributed architectures. What gets me excited isn't just the coding part - it's solving problems end to end. I love that moment when you can trace a user's problem all the way through the system and fix it at the root. There's something deeply satisfying about building something complex that just works.

I'm currently working on a side project called Wayfind for the motorcycle community - trying to solve some real problems I've experienced on long rides. It's one of those projects where engineering meets passion, which is when I do my best work.

## Beyond Code

I have this weird habit of buying furniture and gadgets that require assembly just because I enjoy putting things together. There's something therapeutic about following instructions, using your hands, and ending up with something functional. Maybe it's the same part of my brain that likes architecting systems - everything has its place and purpose.

I read a lot - mostly books that people recommend to me rather than following any particular system. Right now I'm into philosophy (Nietzsche has been fascinating) and anything related to engineering and systems thinking. I started this blog partly to build a writing habit, because I've found that writing helps me think more clearly about both technical problems and life in general.

## Currently

Working on distributed systems in the fintech space, riding whenever I can, and always planning the next long trip. If you're into motorcycles, system architecture, or just want to chat about books, feel free to reach out.
