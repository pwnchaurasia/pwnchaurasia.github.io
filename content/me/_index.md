Hi, I'm Pawan Chaurasia. I'm a software engineer currently building web applications in Bangalore, India.

I'm a software engineer who loves building things - both digital and physical. I've been building backend systems and distributed architectures for about 9 years. What excites me is solving problems end to end - tracing issues through complex systems and fixing them at the root. Currently working on Wayfind, a side project for the motorcycle community.

When I'm not writing code, you'll find me on my Royal Enfield Himalayan exploring roads less traveled. After buying my bike I've covered most of southern India and completed every bike rider's dream ride to Ladakh in 2022.

I read, mostly books people recommend to me rather than following any particular system. I started this blog to build a writing habit because I've found that writing helps me think more clearly about both technical problems and life in general.

I'm sharing my thoughts on books I read, things I build, and lessons I'm learning. I'm learning as I go, making mistakes and improving myself. I'm just exploring the world and tech through experience.

This is my corner of the internet where I think out loud.
